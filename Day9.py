# Typecasting in Python | Python Tutorial - Day #9
# the conversion of data type into other data type is called type casting or type conversion in python.
# Two tyoes of Type casting: 1.Explicit , 2.Implicit
a= "Sultan"
b = " Bhai"
print(a+b)     # answer sultan bhai

# ===================================
# 2.Implicit convesion ( convert python it self).
r = 4
t = 6.9
print(r+t) # answeer 10.9

a = "3"    # String values.
b = "5"    # String values.
print(a+b) # answer 12

# 1.Explicit conversion ( convet values user it self according to his watns).
# But i want to sum it.
A = '3' # String values.
B = '5' # String values.
print (int(A) + int(B))     # Answer is 8 because 3 and 5 is converting in int values.
print (float(A) + float(B)) # Answer is 8.0 because 3 and 5 is converting in float values.
