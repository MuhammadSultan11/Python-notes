x = input('Enter the first number: ')
y = input("Enter the Second number: " )
print(x+y) # If 1st number is 10 and 2nd is 11 answer is 1011, is called concatenation in python.

x = input('Enter the first number: ')
y = input("Enter the Second number: " )
print( int(x) + int(y) )  # If 1st number is 10 and 2nd is 11 answer is 21 because string values converdet into integer values.
print( float(x) / float(y))
