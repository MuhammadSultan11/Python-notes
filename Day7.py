# Exercise 1: Calculator using Python | Python Tutorial - Day #7
# ===============================================================
# print(5+6)   # Addition.
# print(15-6)  # Subtraction.
# print(15*6)  # Multiplication.
# print(15/8)  # Division.
# print(15//8) # Floor Division Means it's output not giving answer in decimal values.
# print(9%5)   # Modulus means reminder after devision.
# print(2**4)  # Exponential means power of 2 is 4.
# ===============================================================
# Q: Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
#    operations on two numbers? Your program should format the output in a readable manner!

a = 6
b = 2
print("6 + 2 = ", a+b)   # Addition.
print("6 - 2 = ", a-b)   # Subtraction.
print("6 * 2 = ", a*b)   # Multiplication.
print("6 / 2 = ", a/b)   # Division.
print("6 % 2 = ", a%b)   # Modulus.
print("6 ** 2 = ", a**b) # Exponential.
print("6 // 2 = ", a//b) # Floor Division.

# ================================================================

# Harry solution:
# n = 6
# m = 2
# ans1 = n+m
# print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
# ans2 = n-m
# print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
# ans3 = n*m
# print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
# ans4 = n/m
# print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
# ans5 = n%m
# print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
# ans6 = n//m
# print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
